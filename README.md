### Local Storage Integration

In SPADS, local storage is used to persist data across page reloads. This ensures that your tasks and notes are not lost even when you refresh the browser window or navigate away from the app.

-   **Saving Data**: Whenever a note is added, edited, or deleted, the updated state is saved to local storage.
-   **Retrieving Data**: When the app loads, it retrieves the tasks and notes from local storage to display on the screen.
-   **How it Works**:
    -   **Saving**: When a note is modified or added, itâ€™s first updated in the state of the React component, then the entire list of notes is stored in local storage using `localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(updatedNotes))`.
    -   **Retrieving**: When the app starts or refreshes, the stored data is loaded with `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('notes'))`, which initializes the note state with previously saved tasks and notes.

By integrating local storage in this way, SPADS ensures your task data is always available, providing a seamless user experience across sessions.
